# Brain and Cognitive Society Online Workshop Apr '20

This repository contains all the lectures and workshop materials for the workshop conducted during March-April 2020. The goal of this workshop is to teach the basics of different technical skills needed for studying brain science to reverse engineer human brain/intelligence to create more general and intelligent AI's for the future world. It covers a range of topics, including:
* Basic Machine Learning
* Computational Modeling
* Psychophysics, Data Analysis and Experiment Design

The lectures and workshop materials are a combination of links to different online resources plus some additional materials created by [Brain and Cognitive Society, IIT Kanpur](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/). Assignments were created by [Brain and Cognitive Society, IIT Kanpur](https://bcs-iitk.github.io/).
